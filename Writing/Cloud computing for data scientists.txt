Cloud computing for data scientists

‘Cloud’ basically  means ‘the internet’ and ‘Cloud computing’ is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Cloud computing allows users to rent/buy physical data servers, storage, databases and computing power from cloud providers under a pay-as-you-go payment scheme. 

Cloud computing is becoming increasingly important not only for software developers, but also for big data analytics. Cloud computing is convenient for data scientists to investigate large data sets because it scales computing power and makes it much easier to deploy data solutions, for example like Microsoft Azure provides wide range of tools for data scientists like Azure SQL, Document DB, Azure Table and Azure Blob, Hadoop (including Hive, MapReduce, Spark, and more) for data storage, providing Azure ML for easy implementation of HD insight and machine learning algorithms. On the other hand  AWS, widely known tools include Redshift, EC2, EMR, S3, Data Pipeline and Database Migration Service are provided for data scientists to enhance their work flow .
Cloud computing helps in data science in various ways for data scientists as a data scientist does not require a high GPU , large number of servers or high storage at their infra , as he/she can buy all these things on demand at instant from cloud providers which would also be much more cheap in cost and reliable for a freelance work . As a Qualified data scientists must learn how to perform a set of tasks in a data pipeline in the cloud and hone their cloud computing skills. This includes data collection, data cleansing, data transformation and data mining, model training and testing using toolkits provided by major cloud platforms, specifically AWS and Azure. Data Scientist at NASA use AWS(Amazon web servies)  service to make their repository for the storage and working  on their space images/videos which requires a large number of computing power and storage as well.
